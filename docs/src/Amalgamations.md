# "Amalgamations"

The following works are re-framings and combinations, or amalgamations, of other artists' works that I thought would be fun to combine into a single coherent piece.

The piece below, which I'm calling *Svegliando*, is a combination of various frames of increasing "zoom level" from Disney's *Pinocchio*, depicting a quiet little town awakening to a new day. Having always been a fan of Tudor-style architecture and artwork depicting scenes from the European countryside, I wanted to take a crack at combining the various frames into a single, larger one. The results are below, together with a time-lapse video showing the process of combining the frames into a single static scene.

This next piece is called *Oddball in Naples*, and is a stylized stitching together of several (7-8) different paintings which caught my wife's and my eye at the Boston Museum of Fine Art. Somewhat coincidentally, several of the paintings happened to be depicting the bay and town of Naples. However, the show-stealer for my wife was a painting of an exotic jungle flower, so that became the "oddball." The final painting and time-lapse creation video are below.
